# Human-model similarity

The bare bones code needed to compute the human model similarity is in the top layer. 

You can recreate the Human-model similarity experiments with PredNet (https://github.com/coxlab/prednet) by going into the PredNet folder. There is a conda enviroment file that will install a conda enviroment that will run the code (prednet-env). The code uses an older version of PredNet and newer versions are easier to get running, and at some point I would like to update this code to reflect the later versions. However, I will need to redo the experiments from the paper with the new code before this can happen.
